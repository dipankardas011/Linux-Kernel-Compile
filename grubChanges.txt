Increase the GRUB_TIMEOUT value to 10 seconds, so grub pauses in menu long enough to choose
a kernel to boot:
* Uncomment GRUB_TIMEOUT and set it to 10: GRUB_TIMEOUT=10
* Comment out GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=hidden
If the newly installed kernel fails to boot, it is nice to be able to see the early messages to figure out
why the kernel failed to boot.
 
Enable printing early boot messages to vga using the earlyprintk=vga kernel boot option:
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="earlyprintk=vga"
